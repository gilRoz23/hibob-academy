- **Feedback Submission**: Employees can submit feedback either anonymously or identified, with validations for content and length.
- **Feedback Viewing**: HR/Admin can view all company feedback and mark it as reviewed.
- **Filtering Feedback**: HR/Admin can filter feedback based on date, department, anonymity, and review status.
- **Response Handling**: HR can respond to non-anonymous feedback, view all feedback responses, and update review status.
